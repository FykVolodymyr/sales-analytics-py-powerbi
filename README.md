# sales-analytics-py-powerbi
This project analyzes the product sales trends from 2019 to 2023, and it relies on trends, product performance, sales channels, customer behavior, and profitability.

The analysis is divided into two main parts:

Python (EDA & Visualizations) → exploratory and descriptive analytics.

Power BI Dashboard → business insights and interactive exploration.

The data are cleaned order transactions with order detail, customer regions, products, sales channels, revenues, and profit margins.

📂 Dataset

Source: Cleaned dataset of customer orders

Timeframe: 2019–2023

Content: Order dates, regions, channels, product details, revenue, profit margin

🚀 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data analysis & visualizations

Power BI → Interactive dashboards & business insights

🐍 Python Analysis & Visualizations

Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics were performed in Python.
The following charts were created:

• Monthly sales revenue trends (2019–2023)

• Monthly sales trends

• Top 10 products by revenue

• 10 lowest-revenue products

• Distribution of average order values

• Total sales distribution by channel

📈 Key Insights: The sales analysis by month indicates that during the four-year time span, there has been no significant improvement towards increasing volumes of sales. There is a general weak positive trend. A strange drop appeared in February 2019, which requires a fundamental analysis that goes deeper.

📈 Key Insights: The analysis of unit price impact on profit margins shows no significant correlation between higher unit prices and increased margins. Instead, margins form distinct clusters, suggesting that the current pricing strategy may need revision. Focusing on higher-margin products within similar price ranges could help drive greater profitability in the future.

📈 Key Insights: The Northeast region appears significantly underdeveloped and may require additional marketing efforts to boost product performance. In other regions, product distribution is relatively balanced, suggesting that exploring opportunities in international markets could be a promising growth strategy.
