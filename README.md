# sales-analytics-py-powerbi
This project analyzes the product sales trends from 2019 to 2023, and it relies on trends, product performance, sales channels, customer behavior, and profitability.

The analysis is divided into two main parts:

Python (EDA & Visualizations) → exploratory and descriptive analytics.

Power BI Dashboard → business insights and interactive exploration.

The data are cleaned order transactions with order detail, customer regions, products, sales channels, revenues, and profit margins.

📂 Dataset

Source: Cleaned dataset of customer orders

Timeframe: 2019–2023

Content: Order dates, regions, channels, product details, revenue, profit margin

🚀 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data analysis & visualizations

Power BI → Interactive dashboards & business insights

🐍 Python Analysis & Visualizations

Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics were performed in Python.
The following charts were created:

• Monthly sales revenue trends (2019–2023)

• Monthly sales trends

• Top 10 products by revenue

• 10 lowest-revenue products

• Distribution of average order values

• Total sales distribution by channel

The sales analysis by month indicates that during the four-year time span, there has been no significant improvement towards increasing volumes of sales. There is a general weak positive trend. A strange drop appeared in February 2019, which requires a fundamental analysis that goes deeper.

It is also significant to note a sharp and considerable decline in sales in February in general. Making special offers or targeted promotions at the time can help to keep customers interested in the products.

Most customers' average spend is 1 million, which might reflect relatively poor customer loyalty. The company is advised to create loyalty programs to increase customer retention and long-term value.

Export sales are modest. Seeking opportunities to expand into new markets globally could help diversify revenue streams and support overall growth.
